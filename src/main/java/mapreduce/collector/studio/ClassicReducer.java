/**
 * An interface used for {@code Collector}s that are similar to Hadoop's
 * reducer. In Hadoop, the collecting of the values into one place is done for
 * you, and you are given an {@link Iterable} of the values. Java's
 * {@code Collector} works a bit differently because it can have any type as its
 * mutable result container. In other words, Java's {@code Collector} is more
 * general, because you don't have to store the values in a list. In this
 * interface, we're making it easier to use Java's {@code Collector} like a
 * Hadoop reducer.
 * 
 * Java's {@code Collector} interface has four methods:
 * {@link Collector#supplier()}, {@link Collector#accumulator()},
 * {@link Collector#combiner()}, and {@link Collector#finisher()}. This
 * interface defines three of those methods.
 * 
 * This interface is built around the list as the mutable result container. The
 * {@code supplier}'s {@code get} method creates a new list, the
 * {@code accumulator}'s {@code accept} method adds an item to the list, and the
 * {@code combiner}'s {@code apply} method combines two lists. The last method,
 * {@code finisher}, must be defined by any class implementing this interface.
 * It finishes the reduction by converting everything in the list into some
 * result type. 
 * 
 * @param <V>
 *            the type of value being reduced
 * @param <R>
 *            the result of the reduction
